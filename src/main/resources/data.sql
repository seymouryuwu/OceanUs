"A catchment, or watershed can be termed as the region of land from where a stream or lake catches or traps water from downpour, ice or snow fall. The water may hang around the ground as surface water, in streams, pools and different wetlands, or it might pass underground to become groundwater, inside layers of permeable soil or rock called aquifers. \nDid you know \"Nitrate from agriculture is the most common chemical contaminant in the world\'s groundwater aquifers.\"\nThe water from these areas for instance from mountains or hills will then flow to a low point which is dam a location on a river, or the mouth of a river where the water enters a bay or the ocean. For example, it\'s just like water in a bathtub flowing to the plughole, or water that falls on a roof flowing to a downpipe or the water from the sinks flowing to the drains. \nDid you know \"Only around 30% to 50% of the rain that falls on Melbourne Water catchments each year ends up in waterways.\"",

For instance, contamination by synthetics/chemicals, soil disintegration because of land clearance, or inordinate water use may bring about a decrease in the soundness of nearby streams and lakes.\nDid you know \"Possible threats to our catchments are Bushfire and Pollution, Human and Animal contamination and  Erosion.\"\nHere are some more facts which you weren\'t aware of.\nDid you know \"Every day, 2 million tons of sewage and industrial and agricultural waste are discharged into the world\'s water (UN WWAP 2003), the equivalent of the weight of the entire human population of 6.8 billion people.\"\nDid you know \"Industry dumps an estimated 300-400 MT of polluted waste in waters every year.\"",
