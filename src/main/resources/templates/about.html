            <h2>This is a story about how we developed this website.</h2>
            <p>When the international team “Sharks in Suits” was talking about the collection and processing of water, one of the brightest sharks in our team advised that we can help everyone understand that things like coffee grounds cannot be thrown into the sink. A coffee lover in the group was shocked! She found that she didn't even know what kind of things could be thrown into the sewer, and she often threw a variety of things into the toilet directly. No wonder her toilet is often blocked!<p>
            <p>We hope to create a platform that can help the lovely people avoid the problem of sewer blockage in the future, and at the same time maintain the operation of the water circulation system. However, just having some theoretical knowledge is too boring, no one wants to read those large paragraphs of text. Therefore, we have integrated and rewritten the content to help everyone better understand and simplify the complicated content to the greatest extent. This website also provides some quiz and games to increase the fun of the platform. Let our friends learn about relevant content in the game and learning in happiness is what everyone hopes. OceanUs includes the "exploration" area waiting for your discovery, here you can learn more about water recycling in Melbourne.</p>
            <p>Hope you can have a good time at OceanUs~</p>
