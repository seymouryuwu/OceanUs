<!--        <h2 class="z-index-2">How much water do we use everyday?</h2>-->
            <br>
            <p>Today, when the world is calling for sustainable development, Melbourne, as the second-largest city in Australia with a population of more than 4.8 million (2019), is also concerned about the pressure of urban water use in various aspects. The rapid development of our city also means that the water supply is facing year-on-year challenges. Reasonable water use is especially important. We hope that not only us, but future residents can also enjoy sufficient water resources.</p>

            <h2>Water Consumption in Melbourne</h2>
            <br>
            <p>How much water does one household need in a day?</p>
            <p>The amount of water consumed by each household does not vary much from year to year, but the value varies from region to region. On the one hand, it is because of the difference in population size; on the other hand, it is also because of the different distribution of water enterprises.</p>

            <h2>TARGET <span class="number-font">155</span></h2>
            <p>At present, the Melbourne government is vigorously promoting "TARGET 155", which means that it hopes that residents will limit water consumption to 155 litres per person per day. Although in 18/19, Melbourne's per capita water consumption was 162, each person can achieve this goal by using 7 litres of water (equivalent to a bucket of water) less per day.</p>

            <h2>What happened about the water used? Where did the things go after you flushed?</h2>
            <p>1 - Disposal: All the stuff runs out of your house through the pipes which connect to your toilet and kitchen. There are more than 320,000 million litres of sewage each year entering Greater Melbourne's sewerage.</p>
            <p>2 - Transfer: After reaching one of three larger trunk sewers then push them to be processed at the treatment plant, which may take about 12 hours.</p>
            <p>3 - Treatment: There are two large treatment plants in Melbourne, they help us with the final step dealing with the sewage.</p>

            <p>After having a general understanding of our daily sewage process, letâ€™s take a look at the average daily sewage volume in the two major sewage recycling stations(ETP & WTP*) in Melbourne.</p>
            <p>When the sewage volume is highest, the two stations will collect nearly 900 million liters of sewage per day on average!</p>

            <h2>WTP: Western Treatment Plant:</h2>
            <p>It is a historic treatment plant in Melbourne and it uses a series of large ponds. The largest one can contain more than 600 million litres sewage. They will become cleaner as bacteria break down the organic material in the water through the work of anaerobic and aerobic lagoons. It nearly takes somewhere around 30 to 35 days for the job to be completed.</p>
            <p>Learn more about WTP here at <a href="https://www.melbournewater.com.au/water-data-and-education/water-facts-and-history/where-your-sewage-goes/sewage-treatment-process">melbournewater.com.au</a></p>

            <h2>ETP: Eastern Treatment Plant:</h2>
            <p>Unlike WTP, the ETP is located in southwest Melbourne and it uses innovative technology to change the sewage into class A recycled water. It is only one-tenth the size of the Western Treatment Plant, but it helps release half of the treatment pressure of the WTP, ETP deals with nearly 330 million litres a day.</p>
